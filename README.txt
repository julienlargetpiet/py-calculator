# py-calculator
Put whatever formula you want and it will be calculated (take in count the priority calculation, parenthesis...)

Example: -(45*9+(e3-9)+(12*5-(2**3)+6)+sin6)/(45/9+(e3+9)+(12*5-(2**3)+6)+sin6) = 5.17
         -lne3 = 3.0
         -4! = 24
         -|-6| = 6
         -e(2+2) = 54.98
         -...
         
Certain variables or loops are probably useless (at the top), feel free to clean.
